What is a Node module? 

A node module is a set of functions that you include in your application. They are essentially the same as Javascript libraries.

What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

Module.exports is the variable that gets returned from `require()` and it’s an empty object by default, but can be reassigned to anything.
Exports is a reference to module.exports, and reassignments are not available outside of the module.

Why is using exports recommended?

Using exports is recommended because it doesn’t require your exports to be of a specific type which is more flexible.
